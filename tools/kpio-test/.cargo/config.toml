# Override parent .cargo/config.toml settings.
# The root workspace targets x86_64-unknown-none with build-std for the no_std kernel.
# This tool is a host-target std binary. On stable toolchain, the parent's [unstable]
# build-std is silently ignored, so we only need to override the build target.
#
# IMPORTANT: Always run with `cargo test` from tools/kpio-test/ directory,
# or use `cargo +stable test --manifest-path tools/kpio-test/Cargo.toml --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
